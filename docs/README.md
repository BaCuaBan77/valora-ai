# Documentation Index

Welcome to the B2B Pricing Estimator System documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the system architecture, components, data models, and implementation.

## Documentation Files

### [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
System architecture overview, technology stack, service communication patterns, and scalability considerations. Includes architecture diagrams and data flow visualizations.

### [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](./SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)
High-level system overview, core purpose, key capabilities, use cases, and value proposition. Provides context for understanding the system's goals and functionality.

### [DATA_MODELS.md](./DATA_MODELS.md)
Detailed documentation of core data models, entity relationships, database schemas, and data flow. Essential for understanding the data structure and storage.

### [COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md)
Comprehensive guide to system components, their responsibilities, interfaces, and interactions. Describes how different parts of the system work together.

### [ML_MODEL.md](./ML_MODEL.md)
Machine learning model documentation including architecture, features, training process, inference, and monitoring. Technical details for the ML pipeline.

### [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)
Implementation guide with phases, tasks, deliverables, and development workflow. Step-by-step guide for building the system.

## Quick Start

1. **New to the project?** Start with [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](./SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) to understand what the system does.

2. **Want to understand the architecture?** Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design and technology choices.

3. **Working with data?** Check [DATA_MODELS.md](./DATA_MODELS.md) for data structures and relationships.

4. **Implementing features?** See [COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md) for component details and [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) for development phases.

5. **Working on ML?** Refer to [ML_MODEL.md](./ML_MODEL.md) for model architecture and training.

## Documentation Standards

- All documentation is written in Markdown
- Code examples use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Diagrams use Mermaid syntax
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples where helpful

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add code examples if introducing new patterns
3. Update architecture diagrams if structure changes
4. Keep the documentation index (this file) current
